Card Counting Program using C programming 

What does this program do ?
Basically card counting is a way of improving the odds when you play blackjack. In blackjack, if there are plenty of high-value cards left in
the shoe, then the odds are slanted in favor of the player.

Card counting helps you keep track of the number of high-value cards left. Say you start with a count of 0.

Card counting is a way to increase your chances of winning at blackjack.
By keeping a running count as the cards are dealt, a player can work out
the best time to place large bets and the best time to place small bets. Even
though it’s a powerful technique, it’s really quite simple.
